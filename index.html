      	  <div id = "about" class = "flex-container">
            <article>
              <p>I used to hate computers so much. All through my 20s I battled with desktop and laptop machines. Scanning, word processing, working with photographs and music. Everything was difficult and counterintuitive. Things happened  that I didn't want to happen. Things wouldn't happen when I <b>did</b> want them to. Whenever I used my computer I felt frustrated, enraged.</p>

      	      <p>But what could I do? I was too old to learn how to deal with modern computers. The days of my ZX Spectrum 48K+ had gone, and I had failed to keep up. I was resigned to feeling put-upon... powerless... oppressed by this technology that should have been there to serve me. I was not in control, I felt... <i>and I never would be</i>.</p>

              <p>Then one year I got a Raspberry Pi in my Christmas stocking. I learned how to flash an SD card with the RPi's version of linux. I learned how to tweak configuration files and install software. I was free to experiment with this little computer because it was cheap and unintimidating. It didn't contain my music, my scanned artwork, my photographs, my CV... if I somehow corrupted the operating system I could just reflash the SD card and start again.</p>

              <p>I realised I didn't have to become an expert overnight. I could learn a little at a time, gaining confidence along the way. I learned how to take risks with my OS and precations with my data. I lost my fear of technology and started to take control of it.</p>

              <p>It's hard for me to say how life-changing this has been for me, because I didn't just learn about computers, I learned something profound about life - that I could take control and change things. If I could overcome this hurdle, at the age of 35, what other problems could I overcome? If communities of programmers could self-organise to produce high-quality software that was free and open, maybe my youthful idealism wasn't as miguided as I'd grown to believe.</p>

              <p>My whole worldview has been transformed by the change in my relationship with technology. I now have confidence to move into a career I can love and into which I channel my creative energies, my analytical skills and, hopefully, my sense of enthusiasm and political motivation as well. Front end web development seems like an ideal way to get started.</p>
