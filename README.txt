Numerous issues with the current incarnation.

A previous version of the page is published [here](http://spitchell.com)

# [Old version](http://spitchell.com):

* did not use flexbox
* had a static sidebox that scaled for mobile phones and tablets, giving a better experience
* missing gallery images, footer etc.

# [New Version](https://spitchell.github.io/spitchcom/):

* responsive, better implemented column text in About
* flexbox gallery that transforms from rows to columns
* does not resize thumbanils, or position them well on the smaller screen
* sizebox navbar does not resize - clashes badly with main content on small screens

# To do:

* understand the mechanisms for both pages and combine to get the desired result in the right place
* do something to partition the viewing sections for the reader... maybe fade in colored container background on screen focus?
* figure out the meaning of all the browser and device compatibility code and start applying it judiciously
* investigate frameworks, starting with the most minimal. Don't need bootstrap yet, but maybe a simple grid would be useful? 
* think about the purpose of the various on-screen furntiture and make sure it is appropriately designed
* think about accessibility. 

# good things

* the fixed navigation div. very simple, but pleasing to achieve!
* negative space is effective, if overly sparse
* limited pallette - similar
* scroll-off image banner. again, basic stuff, but rewarding
* flexbox worked for gallery thumbnails, at least. needs tweaking
* Design fundamentals are OK. Fonts. F-shaped content layout.
